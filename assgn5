The negative operation does not result in the same image if the negative is done in HSI and RGB. This is because in RGB space, we donot consider
the Intensity and Brightness etc. of an object etc. whereas in HSI we do consider. Also, in HSI we can change the intensity of a color etc. but in RGB space any change results in change in color. So, because of these factors, the negatives in RGB and HSI are not same...
